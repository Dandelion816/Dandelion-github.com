<p><strong>The influence of various structures of ZnO products materials on photocatalytic activity</strong>     BUPT
<em>Advisor: Professor Ming Lei, Professor Ke Bi, BUPT</em>           Jan. 2016-Present
“Effects of organic solvents on morphologies and related photoluminescence and catalysis properties of ZnO nanostructures”</p>

<ul>
<li>   Achieved controllable synthesis of ZnO nano-structures with different structures by varying polar organic solvents.</li>
<li>   Employed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to study the phase structures and crystal sizes of ZnO products prepared in various organic solution.<br>
</li>
<li>   Attributed the diversity of ZnO structures to the polarity of organic solvents and their solvating abilities of NaOH mineralizer. </li>
<li>   Demonstrated the size-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties, by which we accomplished 90% photocatalytic efficiency improvement by shrinking the size of the ZnO nanostructure from 1um to 5nm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Research microwave bandpass filter based on Mie-resonance extraordinary transmission</strong>     BUPT
_Advisor: Professor Ming Lei, Professor Ke Bi, BUPT _         Mar. 2016-Jul.2017
“ Microwave bandpass filter based on Mie-resonance extraordinary transmission ”</p>

<ul>
<li>   Designed microwave bandpass filter structure by filling the periodically metallic apertures with high-permittivity and low-loss dielectric Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) ceramic particles. </li>
<li>   Realized a narrow-passband microwave bandpass filter with an insertion loss of 2 dB and a center frequency at 11.82 GHz based on Mie resonance extraordinary transmission.</li>
<li>   Proposed and theoretically simulated a way to fabricate frequency-tunable microwave bandpass filter by varying the size and the permittivity of dielectric particles. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The influence of novel ZnBi2O6 -Graphene Oxide (GO) nano-composites on the photocatalytic activities</strong>       BUPT
_Advisor: Professor Ming Lei, Professor Ru Zhang, BUPT _          Oct. 2013-Jan. 2014
“ One-Step Synthesis of Trirutile Oxides ZnBi2O6 -Graphene Oxide with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity ”</p>

<ul>
<li>   Synthesized ZnBi2O6 -GO composites via a one-step hydrothermal method and achieved the optimal photocatalytic activity with a GO content of 2.0 wt%.</li>
<li>   Employed XRD, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Ramen Spectroscopy to compare the properties of the ZnBi2O6 composite with and without GO.</li>
<li>   Revealed that the improved photo activity can be ascribed to the ability of GO to prolong the lifetime of photo generated electron–hole pairs as well as increase the absorption efficiency of dyes.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Research the influence of porous materials on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) *</em>         BUPT
<em>Advisor: Professor Ming Lei, BUPT</em>           Jul.2015-Apr. 2016 
“Synthesis of hollow porous ZnCo2O4 microspheres as high-performance oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst” </p>

<ul>
<li>   Synthesized hollow porous ZnCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 -xMnxO4 as high-performance oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst. </li>
<li>   Characterized the hollow porous structure with Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM).</li>
<li>   Confirmed that the enhanced catalytic ability of hollow porous ZnCo2O4 microspheres benefits from the more catalytic sites and higher efficiency of reactant exchange.</li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Project: Single quantum dot light source device in Institute of Semiconductors *</em>        Chinese Academy of Science
<em>Advisor: Professor Zhichuan Niu, Institute of semiconductors, CAS</em>           Jan. 2016-Present
Fabricated InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots as single light source via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).</p>

<ul>
<li>   Characterized the surface morphology of InAs/GaAs QDs by Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). </li>
<li>   Detected the single photon emission of InAs/GaAs QDs by Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) Interferometry. </li>
<li>   Simulated luminescent properties of QDs embedded in both Distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) microcavity and micropillar via finite-different time-domain (FDTD). </li>
</ul>
